#Overview

IdentityServer is a .NET/Katana-based framework and hostable component that allows implementing single sign-on and access control for modern web applications and APIs using protocols like OpenID Connect and OAuth2. 

See more details: https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3

This project provides a complete example solution that implements Identity Server 3, Identity Manager and Membershipreboot. For the most part existing examples are dispersed, making it non-intuitive how different moving pieces come together. This project attempts to bring together different moving pieces to show how they can be used to customize a full security suite.
